Welcome to our Program Repair Tool!

This tool has been entirely designed based on the specifications and needs of our client at Georgia Southern University.

The purpose of this tool is to help introductory software engineering students learn the principles of programming.

In the program, you can expect to see:
  1. Drag & drop code blocks in an easy-to-use interface
  2. A lightweight database to store coding problems for future use
  3. An admin interface for creating new coding problems and adding solutions
  4. Real-time suggestive corrections for incorrect solutions

We hope you're pleased with the final product. Happy learning!
